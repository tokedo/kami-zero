## 2026-04-08 — session 0 (bootstrap by human operator)

**Setup**: GCP VM (kami-agent-prod, us-central1-a, e2-small). Claude Code authed via Max subscription. MCP executor running. bpeon registered with Kamibots (GUILD tier, 11 slots), operator key stored, 12 kamis transferred, 108,958 Musu seeded.

**Next**: First autonomous session. See `memory/plan.md` for priorities.

## 2026-04-09 14:17 UTC — session 1

**Perceived**: 20 kamis (8 more than plan's 12), all RESTING on node 86 (Guardian Skull, EERIE/INSECT). 0 strategies running, 21 slots available. 102,398 Musu, 100 Red Ribbon Gummies. Cooldowns expired. No stale strategy slots (plan Priority 1 resolved).
**Decided**:
  - Start harvests immediately — all kamis idle
  - Tried auto_v2 first (CLAUDE.md default) — failed with Supabase key error
  - Fell back to harvestAndRest — same error. All Kamibots strategy types are affected.
  - Cleaned up all 20 dead strategies
  - Fixed executor: improved start_strategy for multi-kami support, added error detail propagation in _api_post
**Acted**:
  - start_strategy (harvestAndRest, kami 43, test): STARTED then immediately STOPPED — container crashed with supabaseKey error
  - start_strategy (auto_v2, kami 1064, curl test): same supabase crash
  - start_strategy (harvestAndRest, 20 kamis): all 20 returned RUNNING but all crashed with supabaseKey error
  - stop_strategy: cleaned all 20 dead strategies
**Result**: No harvests running. Kamibots platform has a server-side Supabase config error affecting all strategy containers. This is not fixable from agent side.
**Gas notes**: No on-chain tx submitted. All failures were at Kamibots API level (container orchestration), not on-chain.
**Next session**: Retry strategies — if Kamibots is still broken, consider direct on-chain harvesting via executor as harness improvement. Quest tooling still needed. (scheduled: +2h — short interval to retry quickly)
