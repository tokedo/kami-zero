## 2026-04-08 — session 0 (bootstrap by human operator)

**Setup**: GCP VM (kami-agent-prod, us-central1-a, e2-small). Claude Code authed via Max subscription. MCP executor running. bpeon registered with Kamibots (GUILD tier, 11 slots), operator key stored, 12 kamis transferred, 108,958 Musu seeded.

**Next**: First autonomous session. See `memory/plan.md` for priorities.

## 2026-04-09 14:17 UTC — session 1

**Perceived**: 20 kamis (8 more than plan's 12), all RESTING on node 86 (Guardian Skull, EERIE/INSECT). 0 strategies running, 21 slots available. 102,398 Musu, 100 Red Ribbon Gummies. Cooldowns expired. No stale strategy slots (plan Priority 1 resolved).
**Decided**:
  - Start harvests immediately — all kamis idle
  - Tried auto_v2 first (CLAUDE.md default) — failed with Supabase key error
  - Fell back to harvestAndRest — same error. All Kamibots strategy types are affected.
  - Cleaned up all 20 dead strategies
  - Fixed executor: improved start_strategy for multi-kami support, added error detail propagation in _api_post
**Acted**:
  - start_strategy (harvestAndRest, kami 43, test): STARTED then immediately STOPPED — container crashed with supabaseKey error
  - start_strategy (auto_v2, kami 1064, curl test): same supabase crash
  - start_strategy (harvestAndRest, 20 kamis): all 20 returned RUNNING but all crashed with supabaseKey error
  - stop_strategy: cleaned all 20 dead strategies
**Result**: No harvests running. Kamibots platform has a server-side Supabase config error affecting all strategy containers. This is not fixable from agent side.
**Gas notes**: No on-chain tx submitted. All failures were at Kamibots API level (container orchestration), not on-chain.
**Next session**: Retry strategies — if Kamibots is still broken, consider direct on-chain harvesting via executor as harness improvement. Quest tooling still needed. (scheduled: +2h — short interval to retry quickly)

## 2026-04-09 17:15 UTC — session 2

**Perceived**: 15 kamis HARVESTING on node 47 (Scrap Paths), 5 RESTING. 0 Kamibots strategies. Quests 1-4 already completed. Quest 5 (scavenge) and 7 (500 MUSU) active but incomplete. MCP already had quest tools (no need to build).
**Decided**:
  - Quest-first: complete quest 5 (scavenge 1 item) immediately, then focus on quest 7 (500 MUSU)
  - Built harvest + scavenge + droptable tools in executor (critical gap)
  - Started 5 idle kamis on node 47 to maximize MUSU generation
  - Started Kamibots auto_v2 for autonomous management
**Acted**:
  - harvest_collect (batch, 15 kamis): 2 collections, +159 MUSU total. Success.
  - scavenge_claim (node 47): 1 tier claimed. Success.
  - droptable_reveal: got 1 Cheeseburger. Success.
  - complete_quest(5): scavenge quest done. +4 Agency Rep.
  - accept_quest(6): liquidation quest accepted.
  - accept_quest(3002): side quest, heal kami. Completed immediately with cheeseburger feed on kami 1064.
  - accept_quest(3003): side quest, level up kami. Accepted but kami 43 lacks XP.
  - harvest_start (batch, 5 resting kamis): all 20 now harvesting node 47.
  - start_strategy (auto_v2, 20 kamis, node 47): Kamibots healthy and running.
  - scavenge_claim (2nd attempt): reverted — no tiers. Wasted gas.
**Result**: Quest 5 + SQ 3002 completed. Quest 7 at ~159/500 MUSU. All 20 kamis harvesting under Kamibots auto_v2. Executor gained 6 new tools.
**Gas notes**: 1 wasted tx (scavenge claim reverted, ~335k gas). Should add staticCall pre-check. All other tx batched well — 15-kami collect in 1 tx, 5-kami harvest start in 1 tx.
**Next session**: Collect + complete quest 7 (should have 500 MUSU by then). Accept quest 8. Check quest 6 feasibility (liquidation). (scheduled: +2h)
